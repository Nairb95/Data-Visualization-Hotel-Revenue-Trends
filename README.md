# Hotel Data Analysis Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to the Hotel Data Analysis Portfolio! In this repository, you will find data and analysis related to two hotels: 'City' and 'Resort'. The primary goal of this project is to provide valuable insights to stakeholders by answering their key questions:

1. **Is the revenue growing by year?**
2. **Should the hotels increase parking lot size?**
3. **What trends can we see in the data?**

To address these questions, we have created SQL queries to obtain relevant data, specifically focusing on revenue growth and market segment analysis.

## Data

The data in this repository includes datasets for both the 'City' and 'Resort' hotels. You can find these datasets in the 'data' directory. The data has been cleaned and preprocessed for analysis.

## SQL Queries

### 1. Revenue Growth Analysis

To understand the revenue growth over the years, I have created an SQL query that retrieves and analyzes revenue data from the database. You can find the SQL script in the 'main' directory under 'revenue_growth.sql'.

### 2. Hotel Market Segment

To determine the arket segment along with the 'meal' data, I have developed an SQL query to obtain the demand based on segments. You can find the SQL script in the 'main' directory under 'market_segment.sql'.

## Power BI Dashboard

To provide stakeholders with a visual representation of the analysis, I have created a Power BI dashboard. You can access and explore the dashboard in the 'power_bi' directory.

## Data Trends Analysis

We have also conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data to identify key trends and patterns. The findings are also located in the power BI dashboard, which have been added to the repository.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to replicate the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Access the 'sql', 'notebooks', and 'power_bi' filees in the main branch for code and analysis details.
3. Install any necessary dependencies specified in the respective files.
4. To run the SQL download and install SQL server Management Studio or other tool for SQL development.
5. Log in to your SQL server (Microsoft SQL server, in this case)
6. Create a database and import the Excel dataset file as SQL database.
7. Run the SQL queries and notebooks as needed.
